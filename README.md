# DMPPlaceholderAPI for DeathMessagesPrime

A simple plugin that allows PlaceholderAPI and MVdWPlaceholderAPI placeholders to be used as DeathMessagesPrime tags with the prefixes ph and phk for PlaceholderAPI and mph and mphk for MVdWPlaceholderAPI.

For example, to access PlaceholderAPI's %player_name% for the dead player, use %ph_player_name% in DeathMessagesPrime death messages (and %phk_player_name% for the killing player). This works with placeholders that use the percent signs (%) as delimiters: for example, %player_name%. To use placeholders that use curly brackets instead (like {player_name}), you use a syntax like %ph_{player_name}%.
